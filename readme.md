# Java Program for Converting Between Array and ArrayList

This Java program allows users to convert an array into an ArrayList and vice versa.

## Files

### Main.java

This file contains the main logic of the program. It prompts the user to choose between converting an array to an ArrayList or an ArrayList to an array. It then uses classes `input` and `converter` to handle user input and perform the conversion.

### input.java

This file contains the `input` class, which handles user input. It prompts the user to enter the total number of elements and then accepts individual numbers for either an array or an ArrayList.

### converter.java

This file contains the `converter` class, which contains methods for converting between an array and an ArrayList.

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java files using `javac Main.java input.java converter.java`.
2. Run the compiled Java program using `java Main`.
3. Choose the desired operation by entering either `1` for converting an array to an ArrayList or `2` for converting an ArrayList to an array.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the total number of elements and the numbers themselves.
5. The program will then print out the converted array or ArrayList.
